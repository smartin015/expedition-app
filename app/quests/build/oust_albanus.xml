  <roleplay title="A Strange Arrival" icon="adventurer">
    <p>Your party arrives in Gruyere, a non-descript plains town known for their
      cheese. The townspeople emerge and see you - they stamp towards you, furious.</p>
    <p>&quot;He&apos;s gone and taken it! He&apos;s taken it all!&quot;</p>
    <p>You attempt to console them, and ask for clarification.</p>
    <p>&quot;Albanus! He&apos;s gone and stolen all of our cheese!&quot;</p>
    <p>This simply won&apos;t do.</p>
    <choice text="Help the villagers recover their precious cheese.">
      <roleplay title="A Strange Arrival" icon="adventurer">
        <p>&quot;Thank you!&quot; they shout, weeping with joy. &quot;That cheese
          is our livelihood here in Gruyere!&quot;</p>
        <p>The small crowd pushes you towards the center of the road, gesturing towards
          an open manhole cover.</p>
        <p>&quot;Albanus lives down there!&quot;</p>
        <p>You&apos;re a bit unsure of where this is going, but you did agree to
          help them.</p>
        <p>Down the fetid hole you go...</p>

            <p>You&apos;ve destroyed the last of the guards... although come to think
              of it, why were they wearing masks?</p>
            <p>Searching through the pockets of your fallen foes, you discover a worn
              map fragment that might solve this mystery.</p>
            <p>The fragment is a map of the town, with a big red X marked on several
              of the streets.</p>
            <p>Curious, you head to the nearest red X, finding an open manhole cover
              leading to the sewers below the town. The bandits must have come from down
              there.</p>

    <p>The sewers smell precisely as bad as you imagined them.</p>
    <p>But wafting on the air, you smell the distinctly foot-like stench of fresh
      Limburger. Albanus can&apos;t have gotten far.</p>
    <p>As you head deeper into the sewers, the light grows dark. A skittering
      sound ahead makes you think you&apos;re not the only one searching for
      a tasty morsel in these tunnels...</p>

    <p>&quot;Looks like they&apos;re from out of town. No one around here&apos;s
      gonna miss &apos;em.&quot; another colder voice replies.</p>
    <p>You open bleary eyes and behold a small cavern in the sewers. Albanus
      and his cronies are huddled by a fire in the center of the room. You and
      your troupe are off in a corner, battered and wounded but still among the
      living.</p>

  <roleplay title="Desperation" icon="adventurer">
    <p>You begin searching for some way out of this mess. You managed to slip
      your bonds - the bandits aren&apos;t very good at tying knots - and you
      immediately see two ways to ruin their day.</p>
    <p>There&apos;s a small powder keg nearby. If it were to &quot;accidentally&quot;
      land in the fire, the walls would probably get a new coat of red paint.
      And soot.</p>
    <p>You also spy a giant rat in a cage, over in the corner. It looks malnourished
      and <em>very</em> hungry.</p>
    <choice text="Toss the powder keg into the fire.">
      <roleplay title="Bang!" icon="adventurer">
        <p>The worry of setting off an explosion in a small, mostly-sealed room is
          dismissed from your mind as you grab the keg and lob it at the fire.</p>
        <p>You leap for cover as a blinding white light erupts, but are thrown to
          the wall, then to the ground by a massive wall of sound and heat.</p>
        <p>Rocks fall around you, but cheese - blasted high above by the explosion
          - falls as well. From the gaping hole in the ceiling you see the curious
          heads of the townsfolk gathering around to look at your stunned party and
          what is apparently a cheese-based weather phenomenon.</p>
        <p>You slump back to the ground, and pass out.</p>

      <roleplay title="A Cheesy Ending" icon="adventurer">
        <p>Awakening some time later, you find yourself in Gruyere&apos;s apothecary
          house; the local herbalist took you in and treated your wounds, free of
          charge.</p>
        <p>&quot;Good ting I was volking down da street ven you blew up da sewers!&quot;
          she exclaimed. &quot;Dere was da brie everywhere!&quot;</p>
        <p>The herbalist tells you the town is safe from the sewer gang and everyone
          is grateful their cheese is safe once again, albeit a bit singed. You thank
          her for her assistance and gather your things, ready for your next journey.</p>

        <p>As you draw back the rusty deadbolt and wrench the door open, the rat
          leaps out and immediately tackles one of the Brigands into the fire. They
          both thrash about the room for some time, and embers are strewn everywhere.
          Eventually the remaining three bandits slay the rampaging rat, but they&apos;re
          visibly shaken from seeing their comrade roasted alive.</p>
